# Example

This project uses custom-managed expo to generate the native iOS and Android code.

Instead of modifying the `/ios` & `/android` folders directly, you'll need to use [prebuilding](https://expo.fyi/prebuilding).

To test the config plugin, run `expo prebuild` and `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to build the app.
